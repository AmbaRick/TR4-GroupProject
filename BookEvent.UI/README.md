# Event Booking App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git@github.com:AmbaRick/TR4-GroupProject.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd BookEvent.UI
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```


### Running the App

To run the app in development mode, execute:
    
    npm start
    
This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. The app will reload automatically if you make edits.

### Building the App

To build the app for production, execute:
    
    npm run build
    

This will create a `build` folder with optimized production-ready assets.

## Future Enhancements

- Enhance UI/UX with styles to make it more appealing and intuitive.
- Fetch events data from API.
- Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Handling Loading and Error States: As API calls are asynchronous, itâ€™s important to display loading states while the data is being fetched and error messages if something goes wrong.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)** - Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)** - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- **[React-Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify)** - It allows you to add notifications to your app with ease.
